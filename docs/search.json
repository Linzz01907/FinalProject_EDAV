    "text": "1.1 Reason for Choosing Salary Topic\nThe process of job selection necessitates a comprehensive evaluation of multiple determinants, including but not limited to job titles, compensation packages, and various associated attributes. It has come to my attention that a considerable number of our peers within the class have been actively engrossed in the endeavor of submitting their curricula vitae and participating in interviews. This pursuit of employment opportunities appears to have evolved into a recurring and pervasive activity, with a majority of individuals consistently engaging in it on an almost daily basis over the preceding four months.\nThis observation has sparked our interest in exploring potential avenues for research pertaining to the realm of employment. As a result, we have discerned that not all students within our cohort exhibit a singular penchant for interning at technology-oriented firms. Some are, in fact, inclined towards pursuing opportunities within municipal government entities, enticed by the prospect of career stability, attractive benefits packages, avenues for professional growth, and competitive compensation levels."

    "text": "1.2 Questions intertested in Salary Topic\nIn our discussion about career choices, we discovered that salary is often the primary concern for most people. Therefore, we decided to explore the various factors that influence salary levels. We aim to identify the key factors influencing job choices, with a particular emphasis on how different elements affect salary levels, for instance, work location, title and work hours. Subsequently, we shall undertake a systematic analysis, dissecting the influence of each of these pivotal factors on salary individually.\nAdditionally, the issue of overtime is something everyone will likely encounter at some point, despite it being a challenge many prefer to avoid. However, certain jobs necessitate extra hours to complete the work. Understanding how overtime pay is calculated and its impact on total salary also merits investigation in our study.\nBy examining these factors, we hope to provide valuable insights that can guide individuals in choosing a job that not only meets their financial needs but also aligns with their broader career goals and expectations."

    "section": "2.2 Research Plan",
    "text": "2.2 Research Plan\nBased on our research questions regarding various factors influencing salary levels and overtime situations in the workplace, we will divide our project into two parts, including total annual salary analysis and overtime analysis.\n\n2.2.1 Salary Analysis\nFirst, we aim to examine the factors that influence salary. These factors encompass year, agency, agency start date, work location, job title, pay basis, and leave status at the end of the fiscal year. Given that these factors encompass both categorical and continuous variables, our objective is to establish the connection between them and salary. Consequently, our analysis will be bifurcated into two components: the examination of the influence of categorical factors on salary, and the exploration of the impact of continuous variables on salary. This approach will enable us to identify the most salient factors significantly affecting salary, warranting a more detailed investigation.\nConcerning year trends and patterns, we aim to understand how salaries have evolved over the past ten years and identify any noticeable trends in employee compensation during specific periods, such as economic downturns or budget cuts. The ‘Year’ field allows for a temporal analysis, facilitating year-over-year comparisons of salaries, thereby revealing trends and patterns over time. Next, we will conduct an agency-specific analysis. Given the potential for significant salary differences across agencies, we seek to determine which agencies have the highest and lowest salaries and understand the reasons behind these disparities. Here, we need to pay attention that low salary accompanied by fewer regular work hours may be indicative by a part-time job. The ‘Agency Name’ field will be used to group data by agency, enabling comparisons of salaries across different departments or units. Regarding the impact of agency start time, we will explore whether the length of time an agency has been operational affects its employees’ salaries. Analysis of the ‘Agency Start Date’ will help investigate if newer agencies offer different pay scales compared to well-established ones.\nWe will also examine geographical disparities, job title, and compensation analysis, as well as the impact of leave status and pay basis on compensation. We will explore how factors like work location, job title, leave status, and pay basis affect salaries. The ‘Work Location Borough’ field will assist in examining if geographic factors influence compensation, considering cost-of-living variations across different boroughs. ‘Job Title Description’ allows for an analysis of salary and overtime payments by role, identifying positions with higher compensation and the reasons behind it. ‘Leave Status’ at the fiscal year’s end will be correlated with total compensation to understand how leave impacts an employee’s overall earnings. ‘Pay Basis’ (monthly, yearly, hourly) will be correlated with overall compensation to understand how different payment structures affect total earnings.\n\n\n2.2.2 Overtime Analysis\nIn this part, we are curious that this overtime work module in different work field or work year. Here we will create a new column called ‘agency size’ based on calculating the number of staffs in different agencies and we will add it into our influence factor test as well. To solve it, we identify patterns and causes of overtime across agencies and job titles by aggregating overtime hours and salaries by job title and agency(agency field, agency start time,year,Work location, agency size), we can highlight where overtime is most common. As for trends in overtime hours and overtime paid: By analyzing ‘OT Hours’ and ‘OT Paid’ across different fiscal years, we can detect any increasing or decreasing trends in overtime. Line graph for overtime hours&salaries is the optimal method to identify their trends over time.\nWe also explore the ratio of regular to overtime hours&salaries across different agencies. We can calculate this ratio for each agency by aggregating ‘Regular Hours’&‘Base Salary’ and ‘OT Hours’&‘OT Paid’ and then compare across agencies. Heatmap is one of our methods to demonstrate the distribution and prevalence of overtime across different job titles and agencies, identifying hotspots. After finishing it, we can compare the consistence of high ration and high overtime hours&salaries by bubble chart where the position on the x-axis can represent overtime hours, the y-axis for the overtime ratio, and the bubble size for agencies or job titles."

Given the mix of categorical and continuous variables, we employ two methods to assess correlations. Firstly, to analyze the correlation between categorical variables and salary, we utilize a heatmap. Specifically, we focus on the areas in the last three columns that lack any white sections, which would indicate a zero correlation. We notice that these columns, corresponding to agency name, job title, and work location, largely lack white areas. This observation leads us to conclude that there is a relationship between salary and these three categorical factors. Notably, the ‘salary low’ column features many red-like colors, suggesting a strong and positive correlation. The next two columns, representing ‘moderate salary’ and ‘very high salary’, appear to have a smaller impact on these factors, showing both weaker correlation and negative correlation. Therefore, our subsequent analysis will concentrate on examining the relationship between salary and these three categorical factors, in contrast to leave status and pay basis, which show weaker correlations.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(GGally)\n\n\nRegistered S3 method overwritten by 'GGally':\n  method from   \n  +.gg   ggplot2\n\n\nCode\np &lt;- salary_new[, c(2, 4:6, 8, 15)]\nlibrary(ggcorrplot)\nmodel.matrix(~0+., data=p) %&gt;%\n  cor(use=\"pairwise.complete.obs\") %&gt;%\n  ggcorrplot(show.diag=FALSE, type=\"lower\", lab=FALSE, lab_size=2)+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 5),  # Adjust size as needed for x axis labels\n        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 5))+\n  labs(title = \"Correlation Heatmap Plot for Categorical Variables\")"

Beginning with the factors of agency and job title, we found that among the ten agencies we examined, the Education Department has the highest average salary, followed by the Fire Department and Police Department. On the other hand, agencies like the Housing Authority, Department of Social Service, and Taxi & Limousine Commission are associated with lower average salaries.\nInterestingly, despite initial expectations, the Tech & Telecommunications Department ranked lower in terms of average salary. However, when analyzing job titles, we discovered that Computer Specialist positions hold the highest average salary. This suggests that within the Tech & Telecommunications Department, there may be roles with comparatively lower salaries, such as those of Call Center Representatives, as indicated in the title analysis. In addition to Computer Specialists, other job titles with relatively high average salaries include Teachers, Special Education Teachers, and Child Protective Specialists. This aligns with our earlier findings, given that the Education Department has the highest average salary. Conversely, positions like City Seasonal Aide and Caretaker are associated with lower salaries, mirroring the trend observed in the lower-paying agencies.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(gridExtra)\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'gridExtra'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':\n\n    combine\n\n\nCode\nq &lt;- salary_new[, c(2, 5, 14)]\nmean_salary_agency &lt;- q %&gt;%\n    group_by(Agency.Name) %&gt;%\n    summarise(mean_value_agency = mean(AnnualSalary, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nmean_salary_title &lt;- q %&gt;%\n    group_by(Title.Description) %&gt;%\n    summarise(mean_value_title = mean(AnnualSalary, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nggplot(mean_salary_agency, aes(x=Agency.Name, y=mean_value_agency)) +\n  geom_segment( aes(x=Agency.Name, xend=Agency.Name, y=0, yend=mean_value_agency)) +\n  geom_point( size=5, color=\"red\", fill=alpha(\"orange\", 0.3), alpha=0.7, shape=21, stroke=2)+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+\n  labs(title = \"Average Salary for Each Agency\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(mean_salary_title, aes(x=Title.Description, y=mean_value_title)) +\n  geom_segment( aes(x=Title.Description, xend=Title.Description, y=0, yend=mean_value_title)) +\n  geom_point( size=5, color=\"red\", fill=alpha(\"orange\", 0.3), alpha=0.7, shape=21, stroke=2)+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+\n  labs(title = \"Average Salary for Each Title\")"

We utilized both a map and a bubble plot to illustrate the distribution of average salaries across New York City. In the map, lighter shades indicate higher salaries. Our findings show that Manhattan has the highest average annual salary at 80,000 dollars. This figure might seem modest, considering that the ten agencies we selected primarily consist of essential yet typically lower-wage agencies. Richmond follows with an average salary of around 70,000 dollars per year. The salary gap is relatively small in the other three boroughs—Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx—where the average is around 65,000 dollars.\nThe bubble plot further highlights salary distributions in other areas of New York. Plotted according to longitude and latitude for precise location mapping, the size of each circle on the plot corresponds to the salary amount; larger circles represent higher salaries. Interestingly, we found that salaries in areas outside the five boroughs we focused on are on average 100,000 dollars higher than those within these boroughs.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tigris)\noptions(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)\noptions(tigris_class = \"sf\")\nnyc_counties &lt;- tigris::counties(state = \"NY\", cb = TRUE) %&gt;% \n  filter(COUNTYFP %in% c(\"005\", \"047\", \"061\", \"081\", \"085\"))  # FIPS codes for NYC boroughs\nsuppressMessages(nyc_counties)\n\n\nSimple feature collection with 5 features and 12 fields\nGeometry type: MULTIPOLYGON\nDimension:     XY\nBounding box:  xmin: -74.25609 ymin: 40.4961 xmax: -73.70036 ymax: 40.91771\nGeodetic CRS:  NAD83\n  STATEFP COUNTYFP COUNTYNS       AFFGEOID GEOID     NAME        NAMELSAD\n1      36      061 00974129 0500000US36061 36061 New York New York County\n2      36      081 00974139 0500000US36081 36081   Queens   Queens County\n3      36      047 00974122 0500000US36047 36047    Kings    Kings County\n4      36      085 00974141 0500000US36085 36085 Richmond Richmond County\n5      36      005 00974101 0500000US36005 36005    Bronx    Bronx County\n  STUSPS STATE_NAME LSAD     ALAND    AWATER                       geometry\n1     NY   New York   06  58683562  29010735 MULTIPOLYGON (((-73.9995 40...\n2     NY   New York   06 281594049 188444349 MULTIPOLYGON (((-73.96262 4...\n3     NY   New York   06 179684484  71158757 MULTIPOLYGON (((-74.04201 4...\n4     NY   New York   06 148982680 117441533 MULTIPOLYGON (((-74.1617 40...\n5     NY   New York   06 109233466  39353304 MULTIPOLYGON (((-73.77336 4...\n\n\nCode\nnyc_counties$BoroName &lt;- factor(nyc_counties$NAME,\n                                levels = c(\"Bronx\", \"Kings\", \"New York\", \"Queens\", \"Richmond\"),\n                                labels = c(\"BRONX\", \"BROOKLYN\", \"MANHATTAN\", \"QUEENS\", \"RICHMOND\"))\n\nave_salary &lt;- salary %&gt;%\n  group_by(Work.Location.Borough) %&gt;%\n  summarize(Average_salary = mean(AnnualSalary, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\nsalary_map &lt;- merge(nyc_counties, ave_salary, by.x = \"BoroName\", by.y = \"Work.Location.Borough\")\n\n\n# Create the map visualization\nggplot(data = salary_map) +\n  geom_sf(aes(fill = Average_salary), color = \"white\", size = 0.5) +\n  geom_sf_text(aes(label = BoroName), size = 3, check_overlap = TRUE) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Average Salary\") +\n  labs(title = \"Average Salary by NYC Borough\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndf_aggregated &lt;- aggregate(AnnualSalary ~ Work.Location.Borough, data = salary, mean)\n\ncoordinates &lt;- data.frame(\n  Work.Location.Borough = c(\"MANHATTAN\", \"BROOKLYN\", \"BRONX\", \"QUEENS\", \"RICHMOND\", \"OTHER\"),\n  x = c(-73.9712, -73.9442, -73.8648, -73.7949, -74.1502, -74.0060),  # Longitude\n  y = c(40.7831, 40.6782, 40.8448, 40.7282, 40.5795, 40.7128)         # Latitude\n)\n\ndf_merged &lt;- merge(df_aggregated, coordinates, by = \"Work.Location.Borough\")\n\nggplot(df_merged, aes(x = x, y = y, size = AnnualSalary)) +\n    geom_point(alpha = 0.5, color = \"pink\") +\n    geom_text(aes(label = Work.Location.Borough), vjust = -1.5, size = 3.5) +  # Place text above the circles\n    scale_size(range = c(10, 35)) +\n    theme_void() +\n    labs(title = \"Average Salary by NYC Borough\")"

    "text": "3.5 Time Series of Salary for Various Agencies and Job Titles\nWe aimed to examine salary changes across different agencies and job titles over time. Our findings indicate a general upward trend in salaries, regardless of agency or title, over the past ten years. However, we noted a unique pattern with the Department of Information Technology & Telecommunications. Its salaries experienced a sharp increase in 2015, followed by minor fluctuations and then a significant drop in 2021. This decline or stagnation in salaries in 2021 and 2022 was observed across many agencies, likely due to the economic downturn caused by the pandemic. However, regarding the Education Department and Department of Social Services, we observed a steady growth in salaries, indicating resilience amid economic challenges.\nFor job titles, the overall trend mirrors that of the agencies with an upward trajectory. However, the salary data across different titles shows considerable variation, as indicated by the scattered lines in our analysis. Notably, the position of City Seasonal Aide, despite having the lowest salary, exhibited unstable changes over the past decade. Its salary increased between 2015 and 2017, then declined, but began to rise steadily again starting from 2019.\n\n\nCode\naverage_salary_agency &lt;- salary %&gt;%\n  group_by(Agency.Name, Fiscal.Year) %&gt;%\n  summarise(average_salary = mean(AnnualSalary, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')\n\naverage_salary_agency |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x=Fiscal.Year, y=average_salary, group=Agency.Name, color=Agency.Name)) +\n    geom_line()+\n    labs(title = \"Evolution of Salaries Across Different Agencies Over Time\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\naverage_salary_title &lt;- salary %&gt;%\n  group_by(Title.Description, Fiscal.Year) %&gt;%\n  summarise(average_salary = mean(AnnualSalary, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')\n\naverage_salary_title |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(x=Fiscal.Year, y=average_salary, group=Title.Description, color=Title.Description)) +\n    geom_line()+\n    labs(title = \"Evolution of Salaries Across Different Titles Over Time\")"

    "text": "3.6 Distribution of Salary of Various Agencies and Job Titles\nThe salary distributions across various agencies display a range of patterns, indicating the diversity in pay scales within the public sector. Agencies like the Department of Finance, HRA/Dept of Social Services, and Fire Department show a concentration in the lower to mid salary ranges, suggesting that a significant portion of their employees earn between 40,000 dollars to 80,000 dollars. In contrast, the Dept of Ed Pedagogical stands out with a considerable number of positions at the higher end of the salary spectrum, nearing 100,000 dollars, which could reflect specialized roles or higher education requirements. The Police Department displays a distinct peak at around 60,000 dollars, hinting at a standard salary level for a common rank or step in the department. The Dept of Info Tech & Telecomm, NYC Housing Authority, and Taxi & Limousine Commission show a more distributed salary range, pointing to a variety of pay grades and positions. Finally, the Admin for Children’s Svcs and the Department of Sanitation have the most diverse spread, with salaries spanning from the lower to upper ends, indicating a broad array of roles and corresponding salaries within these agencies.\nThe second graph displays a collection of histograms that represent the salary distribution for various job titles across a city’s public service roles. The histograms show a wide range of salary distributions, with certain positions like ‘Police Officer’, ‘Teacher’, and ‘Teacher Special Education’ demonstrating higher salary ranges, often peaking around 100,000 dollars. On the other hand, roles like ‘Call Center Representative’, ‘Caretaker’, and ‘City Seasonal Aide’ show a concentration of salaries in the lower range, possibly around 25,000 dollars to 50,000 dollars, suggesting entry-level or part-time positions. Positions such as ‘Clerical Associate’, ‘Community Associate’, and ‘Eligibility Specialist’ have salary distributions that span a medium range, with concentrations not as high as specialized roles like ‘Emergency Medical Specialist-EMT’ or ‘Firefighter’, which also show a wider range of salaries. This pattern underscores the variation in compensation that correlates with the nature of the job, required qualifications, and the level of responsibility inherent to each role.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(average_salary_agency, aes(x = average_salary)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1000, fill = \"lightblue\", color = \"black\") +\n  facet_wrap(~Agency.Name) + \n  theme(strip.text.x = element_text(size = 7))+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))+\n    labs(title = \"Salary Distribution Across Different Agencies\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(average_salary_title, aes(x = average_salary)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 2000, fill = \"lightblue\", color = \"black\") +\n  facet_wrap(~Title.Description) + \n  theme(strip.text.x = element_text(size = 7))+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))+\n    labs(title = \"Salary Distribution Across Different Titles\")"

    "text": "3.7 Correlation between OverTime Hour/Pay with other variables\nBased on the related variables of base salary from part 1, we intend to explore the relationship between over time and them. Part 1. Correlation between OverTime Hour/Pay with category variables. Here we use the ANOVA test to evaluate the correlation between Over Time Hour/Pay and Agency.Name, Title.Description, Job_type, Work.Location. The result shows that Agency.Name, Title.Description, Job_type, Work.Location have low P-value which indicates significant differences between them. Therefore, it proves that they have correlation. To visualize the test, We use box plot to show the distribution or mean levels of the variable of interest Over Time Hour/Pay across different groups like Agency.Name, Title.Description, Job_type, Work.Location. Expect for Box Plot of pay_per_hour across Different Work Locations, the medium line inside the boxes has noticeably different levels for different categories. Second, for each graph, there exist varying box zizes which represents the significantly different interquartile ranges. Here we consider plot 1 as a reference. the agency like Children’s SVCS, Sanitation, Fire Department, Social Services, NYC Housing, Police have more variability than the other groups. Third, there exist various symmetry of the boxes. The agencies like Children’s SVCS, Social Service, Taxi & Limousine represent left-skewness distribution, while Sanitation, Fire Department, NYC Housing, Police shows zero-skewness distribution. Fourth, we observe the different numbers of outliers among groups. Info Tech Department has less outliers than other groups which suggests that this group has less extreme values. Considering Box Plot of pay_per_hour across Different Work Locations, it shows the similar medium line and box sizes and the different parts like symmetry and outliers are not obvious than other graphs. Based on the ANOVA test, we think that Over Time pay per hour is related to Work Locations.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(salary, aes(x = Agency.Name, y = OT.Hours)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  labs(title = \"Box Plot of OT.Hours across Different Agencies\",\n       x = \"Agency Name\",\n       y = \"OT Hours\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(salary, aes(x = Title.Description, y = OT.Hours)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  labs(title = \"Box Plot of OT.Hours across Different Titles\",\n       x = \"Title Description\",\n       y = \"OT Hours\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(salary, aes(x = job_type, y = OT.Hours)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  labs(title = \"Box Plot of OT.Hours across Different Titles\",\n       x = \"Job_type\",\n       y = \"OT Hours\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(salary, aes(x = Work.Location.Borough, y = OT.Hours)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  labs(title = \"Box Plot of OT.Hours across Different Work Locations\",\n       x = \"Work Locations\",\n       y = \"OT Hours\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsalary_tep2&lt;-salary\nsalary_tep2&lt;-salary_tep2[salary_tep2$pay_per_hour &gt;

The Fire Department is consistently the top in overtime hours in the whole period. Police, Social Service, NYC housing department fluctuate during the period and the OT hours in recent year is higher than the beginning year. The other departments show a stable pattern. Combining with the figure, the high OT hours is because some job titles in these apartment lead among all job titles like firefighter, sanitation worker. In terms of over time pay, some lines show an upward trend in recent years such as department of sanitation, fire department, police department and the job title called sanitation worker has the most pay of over time in 2023. The OT pay of taxi & limousine commission has a obvious drop in 2023, but the over time hours remain unchanged. Noticeably, the over time hours of ‘DEPT OF ED PEDAGOGICAL’ is close to 0 all the time.

    "text": "5.1 Main Takeaways\nOur Exploratory Data Analysis revealed significant correlations between salary levels and factors like agency name, job title, work location, agency size, job type and overtime hours & overtime pay. We highlighted how different agencies and job titles influence salary levels, how different salary performance in different regions in New York with particular attention to overtime payments and duration.\nIn our project, we divide the analysis into 2 parts. Here we summarize the important conclusions. In terms of part 1 - Base Salary, we gain the top 3 agencies with high annual salaries which are the department of ED Pedagogical, Fire Department, Police Department where teacher, teacher special education are also in the top 3 base salary among all job titles. It’s worth noting that the computer specialist does not belong to agencies with a high salary, but this job has the highest salary among all job titles. Moreover, in the last 10 years, the salary of all agencies and job titles show an upward trend but the salary data across different titles shows remarkable variation. Additionally, Manhattan has the highest annual salary among all other regions in New York.\nIn terms of part 2 - Overtime hours and salary, we discover that the agencies like department of finance, department of Info Tech, Taxi commission have low overtime hours and department of pedagogical even doesn’t have overtime, while fire department has the most overtime hours especially for firefighters. Besides, the department of sanitation, fire department, and police department have high overtime pay and the job title police dominates, while the department of finance has lowest overtime pay. Job titles like police officers and firefighters often correlate with higher overtime pay and hours, and they vary significantly with each other, whereas departments like Social Service, and Children’s Services show more uniform OT pay distributions. From 2022 to the present, the overtime hours show a downward trend and overtime pay shows an upward trend, except the decreasing overtime pay in the Taxi & Limousine Commission. It indicates that the government is paying attention to the quality of life of the people. Additionally, Manhattan has the lowest overtime rate.\nWhen we consider both base salary and overtime pay, there are distinct patterns, with some roles like emergency medical specialists showing high values in both, while others like sanitation workers have high salaries but shorter overtime hours. Conversely, roles like sanitation workers, despite high salaries, often see fewer overtime hours, suggesting a different compensation structure in these positions."

Third, our data exploratory has limited generalizability because it only focuses on the agencies and job titles with higher employees in New York, so our conclusion may not be proper for all employees in New York. Fourth, due to the large number of dataset, some graphs may not include all the employees in order to have a clear graph and our method of random sample is default, which may lead to missing patterns."

Considering data preparation, we should realize that blank space cannot be recognized by missing value detection. Besides, it will be easier if we finish all new column establishment in the beginning. As for data interpretation, we should pay attention that some data has representativeness, but these data may also have limitations. Furthermore, when we analyze the data by visualization, we should not only analyze the numbers but also understand the context, the underlying trends, and what they signify in the broader spectrum."
