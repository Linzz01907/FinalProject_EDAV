    "text": "Choosing a job involves considering various factors such as the job title, salary, and other attributes. I’ve noticed that many students in our class have been actively engaged in submitting resumes and participating in interviews. The process of seeking job opportunities seems to be a frequent activity, one that most people undertake almost daily over the past four months.\nThis observation has led us to consider the possibility of conducting research related to work. Through this, I’ve learned that not all students are interested in interning at Internet companies. Some are drawn to working in city government, attracted by its career stability, benefits, opportunities for career development, and competitive salary levels.\n\n\n\nIn our discussion about career choices, we discovered that salary is often the primary concern for most people. Therefore, we decided to explore the various factors that influence salary levels. We aim to identify the key factors influencing job choices, with a particular emphasis on how different elements affect salary levels, for instance, work location, title and work hours.\nAdditionally, the issue of overtime is something everyone will likely encounter at some point, despite it being a challenge many prefer to avoid. However, certain jobs necessitate extra hours to complete the work. Understanding how overtime pay is calculated and its impact on total salary also merits investigation in our study.\nBy examining these factors, we hope to provide valuable insights that can guide individuals in choosing a job that not only meets their financial needs but also aligns with their broader career goals and expectations."

    "section": "2.2 Research Plan",
    "text": "2.2 Research Plan\nCore Topic: The Impact of Agency Characteristics on Employee Compensation and Work Patterns. We will introduce our research questions from the introduction into 3 parts:\n\nFactor Analysis First, we aim to examine the factors that influence salary. These factors encompass year, agency, agency start date, work location, job title, pay basis, and leave status at the end of the fiscal year. Additionally, base salary, and regular gross paid are considered. Altogether, we have nine influencing factors. Our goal is to understand not only the impact of each individual factor on salary but also the combined effect of multiple factors on salary.\n\nWe begin by analyzing the individual factors affecting salary. Concerning year trends and patterns, we aim to understand how salaries have evolved over the past ten years and identify any noticeable trends in employee compensation during specific periods, such as economic downturns or budget cuts. The ‘Year’ field allows for a temporal analysis, facilitating year-over-year comparisons of salaries, thereby revealing trends and patterns over time. Next, we will conduct an agency-specific analysis. Given the potential for significant salary differences across agencies, we seek to determine which agencies have the highest and lowest salaries and understand the reasons behind these disparities. The ‘Agency Name’ field will be used to group data by agency, enabling comparisons of salaries across different departments or units. Regarding the impact of agency start time, we will explore whether the length of time an agency has been operational affects its employees’ salaries. Analysis of the ‘Agency Start Date’ will help investigate if newer agencies offer different pay scales compared to well-established ones.\nWe will also examine geographical disparities, job title, and compensation analysis, as well as the impact of leave status and pay basis on compensation. We will explore how factors like work location, job title, leave status, and pay basis affect salaries. The ‘Work Location Borough’ field will assist in examining if geographic factors influence compensation, considering cost-of-living variations across different boroughs. ‘Job Title Description’ allows for an analysis of salary and overtime payments by role, identifying positions with higher compensation and the reasons behind it. ‘Leave Status’ at the fiscal year’s end will be correlated with total compensation to understand how leave impacts an employee’s overall earnings. ‘Pay Basis’ (monthly, yearly, hourly) will be correlated with overall compensation to understand how different payment structures affect total earnings.\n\nOvertime Analysis(OT column)\n\n\nIdentify patterns and causes of overtime across agencies and job titles by detecting the relationship between agency,Agency start time,year,Work location,job Title and overtime respectively. Once the main causes are found, we search for the prevalent characters in these causes. (From our guess, it should include job titles or agencies)\nDetermine if overtime is the norm. Analyze the ratio of regular hours to overtime hours across different agencies.\n\n\nMulti-factor mixed analysis Analyzing the relationship between employment duration, salary, and rank within agencies. Here we plan to choose mosaic and slope graph as analysis tool.\n\nFinally, we will conduct an analysis of salary encompassing multiple elements. Concerning base salary and other factors, we aim to explore trends in base salaries across various job titles and agencies. Key questions include how the base salary relates to the total amount paid during the fiscal year and how it correlates with total compensation. To investigate this, we will employ data from multiple columns using methods such as group by. The ‘Base Salary’ field is essential for analyzing salary trends across different roles and agencies and understanding its relationship with total compensation. By examining both ‘Base Salary’ and ‘Total Gross Paid’, we can discern the proportion of earnings derived from base pay as opposed to overtime and other forms of compensation."
