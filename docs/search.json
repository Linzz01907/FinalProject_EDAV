    "text": "1.1 Reason for Choosing Salary Topic\nChoosing a job involves considering various factors such as the job title, salary, and other attributes. I’ve noticed that many students in our class have been actively engaged in submitting resumes and participating in interviews. The process of seeking job opportunities seems to be a frequent activity, one that most people undertake almost daily over the past four months. This observation has led us to consider the possibility of conducting research related to work. Through this, I’ve learned that not all students are interested in interning at Internet companies. Some are drawn to working in city government, attracted by its career stability, benefits, opportunities for career development, and competitive salary levels."

Therefore, we decided to explore the various factors that influence salary levels. We aim to identify the key factors influencing job choices, with a particular emphasis on how different elements affect salary levels, for instance, work location, title and work hours.
